Milestone 1: Environment Preparation 

In this stage you will be working with CVAT - you need to install CVAT locally to your laptop/desktop and we urge you to follow the docker setup instructions here

PS: You can also create an account on the cvat.ai site but we dont offer any guarantees that the project can be delivered in its entirety with a cvat instance that is not managed by you.

Submit a github repository with a branch titled ‘milestone-1’ with the readme file containing the CVAT installation instructions you followed and a screenshot of your computer of the login screen. Add as collaborator the TA.
